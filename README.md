### smart contract
Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary's involvement or time loss.

In terms of smart contract, `smart` means doing  something automatically.
This idea itself isn't new. (advocated by Nick Szabo in 90s)

ex vendor machine  
```
Pre-definition --->          event            --->  execution(change ownership)   
(price)              (payment + select a can)       (get an ownership)
```

#### merit
- reliability   
smart contract doesn't require a third person (like a bank) and blockchain is secure, so it's difficult to falsify.  

- transparency  
a smart contract and its dealing result are stored on blockchain. Easy to detect illicit dealings. 

- cheap fee  
There is no fee for a third person


#### demerit
A smart contract on public blockchain isn't cancel/roll back by anyone.  
But on private blockchain, they are possible.
