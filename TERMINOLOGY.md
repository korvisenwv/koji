## Fiat(money)
Fiat money is a government-issued currency that is not backed by a commodity such as gold. Fiat money gives central banks greater control over the economy because they can control how much money is printed. Most modern paper currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, are fiat currencies.


## mining

## proof of work
Proof of Work (PoW) is the mechanism that allows the decentralized blockchain network to come to consensus, or agree on things like account balances and the order of transactions. This prevents users "double spending" their coins and ensures that the Ethereum chain is incredibly difficult to attack or overwrite.



## transaction
Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts. An account will initiate a transaction to update the state of the blockchain network.

## block
Blocks are batches of transactions with a hash of the previous block in the chain. This links blocks together (in a chain) because hashes are cryptographically derived from the block data. This prevents fraud, because one change in any block in history would invalidate all the following blocks as all subsequent hashes would change and everyone running the blockchain would notice.

## wallet
An application that let a user intracts with his/her account.  
- hardware wallet 
- mobile 
- web wallet (browser)
- desktop app

## Ethereum
Ethereum is a technology that lets you send cryptocurrency to anyone for a small fee. It also powers applications that everyone can use and no one can take down.
2.0 is moving from Proof of work to staking

## staking
Staking is the process of actively participating in transaction validation (similar to mining) on a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. On these blockchains, anyone with a minimum-required balance of a specific cryptocurrency can validate transactions and earn Staking rewards.

## node
"Node" refers to a running piece of client software. A client is an implementation of blockchain that verifies all transactions in each block, keeping the network secure and the data accurate.

## 51 percent attack/majority attack
A 51% attack is a potential attack on a blockchain network, where a single entity or organization is able to control the majority of the hash rate, potentially causing a network disruption. In such a scenario, the attacker would have enough mining power to intentionally exclude or modify the ordering of transactions. They could also reverse transactions they made while being in control - leading to a double-spending problem.

## DApp

## Truffle
Truffle is the most popular development framework for Ethereum with a mission to make your life a whole lot easier.  

## Web3
web3.js is a collection of libraries that allow you to interact with a local or remote ethereum node using HTTP, IPC or WebSocket.
