## Fiat(money)
Fiat money is a government-issued currency that is not backed by a commodity such as gold. Fiat money gives central banks greater control over the economy because they can control how much money is printed. Most modern paper currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, are fiat currencies.


## mining

## proof of work (PoW)
Proof of Work (PoW) is the mechanism that allows the decentralized blockchain network to come to consensus, or agree on things like account balances and the order of transactions. This prevents users "double spending" their coins and ensures that the Ethereum chain is incredibly difficult to attack or overwrite.


## staking
Staking is the process of actively participating in transaction validation (similar to mining) on a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. On these blockchains, anyone with a minimum-required balance of a specific cryptocurrency can validate transactions and earn Staking rewards.    
  
ex: requirements of Ethereum  
- A minimum of 32 ETH per validator
- Computer with sufficient hardware specs
- Internet connection

## proof of stake (PoS)

## transaction
Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts. An account will initiate a transaction to update the state of the blockchain network.

## block
Blocks are batches of transactions with a hash of the previous block in the chain. This links blocks together (in a chain) because hashes are cryptographically derived from the block data. This prevents fraud, because one change in any block in history would invalidate all the following blocks as all subsequent hashes would change and everyone running the blockchain would notice.

## wallet
An application that let a user intracts with his/her account.  
- hardware wallet 
- mobile 
- web wallet (browser)
- desktop app

## Ethereum
Ethereum is a technology that lets you send cryptocurrency to anyone for a small fee. It also powers applications that everyone can use and no one can take down.
2.0 is moving from Proof of work to staking

## staking
Staking is the process of actively participating in transaction validation (similar to mining) on a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. On these blockchains, anyone with a minimum-required balance of a specific cryptocurrency can validate transactions and earn Staking rewards.

## bitcoin address

## node
"Node" refers to a running piece of client software. A client is an implementation of blockchain that verifies all transactions in each block, keeping the network secure and the data accurate.

## 51 percent attack/majority attack
A 51% attack is a potential attack on a blockchain network, where a single entity or organization is able to control the majority of the hash rate, potentially causing a network disruption. In such a scenario, the attacker would have enough mining power to intentionally exclude or modify the ordering of transactions. They could also reverse transactions they made while being in control - leading to a double-spending problem.

## Truffle
Truffle is the most popular development framework for Ethereum with a mission to make your life a whole lot easier.  

## Web3
web3.js is a collection of libraries that allow you to interact with a local or remote ethereum node using HTTP, IPC or WebSocket.

## Hyperledger
Opensource blockchain platform that is developed by Linux Foundation.

## Solidity
A programming language for developing a smart contract on Ethereum blockchain network. The syntax is similart to Javascript.

## DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)
One of the major features of digital currencies is that they are decentralized. This means they are not controlled by a single institution like a government or central bank, but instead are divided among a variety of computers, networks, and nodes. In many cases, virtual currencies make use of this decentralized status to attain levels of privacy and security that are typically unavailable to standard currencies and their transactions.

Ex The DAO --> failed   
$50M  
1. Allow hackers to take $50M
2. soft folk --> cancel hacker's address and Ether(lose $50M)
```
In blockchain technology, a soft fork is a change to the software protocol where only previously valid transaction blocks are made invalid. Because old nodes will recognize the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is backwards-compatible. This kind of fork requires only a majority of the miners upgrading to enforce the new rules, as opposed to a hard fork that requires all nodes to upgrade and agree on the new version.
```
4. hard folk --> get back $50M, but create an unexpected case(Centralized operation)
```
A hard fork (or hardfork), as it relates to blockchain technology, is a radical change to a network's protocol that makes previously invalid blocks and transactions valid, or vice-versa. A hard fork requires all nodes or users to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software.
```

## DEX
A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace that connects cryptocurrency buyers and sellers. In contrast to centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized platforms are non-custodial, meaning a user remains in control of their private keys when transacting on a DEX platform.

## ICO (Initial Coin Offering)
ICO is a popular fundrasing method for blockchain startups/projects. It's similar to IPO.  

## Altcoin
Alternative coin that is a cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Ex, Eth, Dogecoin, Litecoin Ripple etc.
