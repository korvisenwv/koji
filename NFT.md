### smart contract
Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary's involvement or time loss.

In terms of smart contract, `smart` means doing  something automatically.
This idea itself isn't new. (advocated by Nick Szabo in 90s)

ex vendor machine  
```
Pre-definition --->          event            --->  execution(change ownership)   
(price)              (payment + select a can)       (get an ownership)
```

#### merit
- reliability   
smart contract doesn't require a third person (like a bank) and blockchain is secure, so it's difficult to falsify.  

- transparency  
a smart contract and its dealing result are stored on blockchain. Easy to detect illicit dealings. 

- cheap fee  
There is no fee for a third person


#### demerit
A smart contract on public blockchain isn't cancel/roll back by anyone.  
But on private blockchain, they are possible.


### mint
`mint` means registering the token on the blockchain and associating the token with mdeia file such as an image/video file on a market place.
When we mint, we have to pay the fee, gas by cryptocurrency. The place is varied by a platform and blockchain.
Currently, most platforms support Ethereum. If you use it, a buyer needs to use Ether to pay.

### gas
In this case, gas is the fee for minting.

### nft marketplace
The general issue is that people need to purchase Ether on exchange platform(coinbase, crypto.com, binance, etc) and send eth to their wallet such as metamask to use nft marketplace.    
   
gas fee is expensive now.
